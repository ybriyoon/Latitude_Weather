# Web-Visualization

I used the weather plot data from the previous Python API Homework as the image sources and the cities data content to create an interactive html dashboard.
The dashboard is available at: https://ybriyoon.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/
In the Images folder, you will find the screenshots of the different pages of the dashboard, both in small screen and large screen versions.
